## Descriptive Branch Naming

Branches in Git are named descriptively to enhance clarity and collaboration within a team. When branches have clear, specific names, it is easier for team members to understand the purpose and scope of the work being done in each branch. For example, instead of naming a branch fix-bug, a more descriptive name like fix-login-authentication-bug provides immediate insight into what the branch addresses. This practice reduces confusion, facilitates better communication, and helps in tracking the progress of various features, bug fixes, and experiments. Descriptive branch names are especially important in larger projects with many contributors, as they provide a quick reference to the context of the changes, making code reviews and integration smoother and more efficient.
